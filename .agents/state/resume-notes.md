# Where I stopped — the hand-written half

`mobile/scripts/resume-status.mjs` derives everything it can: the branch, the
dirty tree, the last commits, the Supabase queue, the open notes under
`.agents/queue/`, and whether the repo still holds its load-bearing paths.
This file is the part no script can derive — **what you were in the middle of,
and what you were about to do next.**

## How to write an entry

Append at the **bottom**, newest last. The heading must be

    ## YYYY-MM-DD — <tool> — <one line>

because the report parses that date and prints the entry's age. It also
compares that date against the last commit: an entry older than HEAD is
printed as *history*, not as status, which is the honest answer for prose that
the code has since overtaken.

Keep an entry to about fifteen lines. It is read cold, by someone with no
context and no chat history, on a different account. Four headings earn their
place:

- **DONE** — what is finished and verified. Say *how* it was verified;
  "bundle builds" and "seen on a device" are different claims and this project
  keeps them apart (`.agents/rules/92-verify.md`).
- **HALF-DONE** — what is written but not finished, and where the seam is.
  This is the expensive one to omit; it is what gets rebuilt from scratch.
- **NEXT** — the single next action, concretely enough to start on.
- **DO NOT** — anything you tried that was wrong. HANDOFF §14.2 is the model:
  a cleanup that would have deleted 220 correct diagram rows, written down so
  the next session does not have the same good idea.

Anything blocked on a **person** goes in `blocked.json` instead, with the
owner named. Anything blocked on **Supabase** goes in the queue
(`node scripts/supabase-queue.mjs add`). This file is for work in flight.

`HANDOFF.md` stays what it is: the long, curated, per-session record. This file
is the short volatile one that is rewritten constantly. If an entry here is
still true a week later, it has become history — move it into `HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Claude Code — built the resume mechanism itself

**DONE**

- `mobile/scripts/resume-status.mjs` + `npm run resume` (mobile and root).
  Derives git state, ages the hand-written files against HEAD, reads the
  Supabase queue and `.agents/queue/`, and runs the three integrity checks.
  Offline by design — it must work on a fresh clone behind the agent proxy.
- `mobile/scripts/repo-intact-check.mjs` + `npm run check:repo-intact`. Floors,
  not exact counts; fires on a missing, emptied or shrunk load-bearing path,
  and on a *staged* deletion under `src/data/`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`,
  `.github/workflows/` or `supabase/migrations/`.
- `.claude/skills/session-resume/` for Claude Code,
  `.agents/rules/05-resume.md` for Antigravity/Cursor/Codex, and a row in
  `AGENTS.md`. `CLAUDE.md`'s table is generated — `npm run sync:agent-docs`.
- `.agents/REPO-PROTECTION.md`: what actually protects the repository, with
  click paths, and honest about which half is the owner's alone.
- Fixed a **pre-existing** `check:agent-docs` failure:
  `.agents/rules/63-anki-import.md` pointed at `mobile/src/lib/apkgFormat.ts`
  and `mobile/src/lib/apkgExport.ts`. Both live at `src/lib/` (shared, the
  root tree) which is what `CLAUDE.md` says. Three dead pointers, so the check
  had been failing on this branch before this session touched it.

**NEXT** — nothing outstanding in this lane. The next session's first command
is `npm run resume`.

**DO NOT** — do not make the resume report exit non-zero when an integrity
check fails. It is wired into a `SessionStart` hook and into `&&` chains; a
report that fails is read as a broken tool and gets removed. The *check* fails
the build, in CI, which is where a failure belongs.
